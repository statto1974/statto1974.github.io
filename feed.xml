                <p>Currently there are no direct methods to enable <strong>Audience Targeting</strong> on a <strong>List</strong> or <strong>Library</strong> via script or code.</p>
<p>This is currently done through the List or Library Settings screen under <strong>Audience targetting</strong> settings option</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wutek.co.uk/media/posts/38/settings.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://wutek.co.uk/media/posts/38/responsive/settings-xs.jpg 300w ,https://wutek.co.uk/media/posts/38/responsive/settings-sm.jpg 480w ,https://wutek.co.uk/media/posts/38/responsive/settings-md.jpg 768w"  alt="Image description" width="990" height="200" /></figure></p>
<p>When you enable audience targeting through these settings, a field is created in the corresponding <strong>List</strong> or <strong>Library</strong> called <strong>Target Audiences</strong></p>
<p>Using the <code>Get-PnpField</code> PnP PowerShell command to get the <code>SchemaXml</code> property we can see how the field is constructed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ps">(Get-PnPField -Identity &quot;Target Audiences&quot; -List Documents).SchemaXml</code></pre>
<p>This is the XML returned</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">
&lt;Field 
  ID=&quot;{61cbb965-1e04-4273-b658-eedaa662f48d}&quot; 
  Type=&quot;TargetTo&quot; 
  Name=&quot;Target_x0020_Audiences&quot; 
  DisplayName=&quot;Target Audiences&quot; 
  Required=&quot;FALSE&quot; 
  SourceID=&quot;{803a362c-54fb-47c7-83c8-e7a83a9512f8}&quot; 
  StaticName=&quot;Target_x0020_Audiences&quot; 
  ColName=&quot;ntext2&quot; 
  RowOrdinal=&quot;0&quot; Version=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Customization&gt;
    &lt;ArrayOfProperty&gt;
      &lt;Property&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;AllowGlobalAudience&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Value xmlns:q1=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; p4:type=&quot;q1:bo
olean&quot; xmlns:p4=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;true&lt;/Value&gt;
      &lt;/Property&gt;
      &lt;Property&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;AllowDL&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Value xmlns:q2=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; p4:type=&quot;q2:boolean&quot; xmlns:p4=&quot;http://www.w
3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;true&lt;/Value&gt;
      &lt;/Property&gt;
      &lt;Property&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;AllowSPGroup&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Value xmlns:q3=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; p4:type=&quot;q3:boolean&quot; xmlns:p4=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-ins
tance&quot;&gt;true&lt;/Value&gt;
      &lt;/Property&gt;
    &lt;/ArrayOfProperty&gt;
  &lt;/Customization&gt;
&lt;/Field&gt;</code></pre>
<p>After some experimenting, I found that the only two columns you need to set are the <code>ID</code> and <code>Type</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ID</code> needs to have <strong>61cbb965-1e04-4273-b658-eedaa662f48d</strong> set as itâs value</p>
<p><code>Type</code> needs to have <strong>TargetTo</strong> set as itâs value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You still need to provide values for <code>Name</code>, <code>DisplayName</code>, <code>StaticName</code>, but they can be whatever you want.</p>
<p>Donât like the name <strong>Target Audiences</strong> then you can change it to something else. The great thing is, it can still be turned off through the List or Library settings page.</p>
<p>To enable Audinence targeting using PnP PowerShell itâs as simple as running this script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ps">
$credentials = (Get-Credential)

Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/somesite -Credentials $credentials

Add-PnPFieldFromXml &#39;&lt;Field ID=&quot;{61cbb965-1e04-4273-b658-eedaa662f48d}&quot; Type=&quot;TargetTo&quot; Name=&quot;Target_x0020_Audiences&quot; StaticName=&quot;Target_x0020_Audiences&quot; DisplayName=&quot;Target Audiences&quot; /&gt;&#39; -List Documents</code></pre>
<p>And to do the same thing in C# CSOM</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">
// from SharePointPnPCoreOnline Nuget package
var manager = new OfficeDevPnP.Core.AuthenticationManager();

string siteUrl = &quot;https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/somesite&quot;;
string appId = &quot;your-app-id&quot;;
string appSecret = &quot;your-app-secret&quot;;

using (var context = manager.GetAppOnlyAuthenticatedContext(siteUrl, appId, appSecret))
{

    var list = context.Web.Lists.GetByTitle(&quot;Documents&quot;);

    var fieldSchemaXml = @&quot;
        &lt;Field 
            ID=&#39;{61cbb965-1e04-4273-b658-eedaa662f48d}&#39; 
            Type=&#39;TargetTo&#39; 
            Name=&#39;Target_x0020_Audiences&#39; 
            StaticName=&#39;Target_x0020_Audiences&#39; 
            DisplayName=&#39;Target Audiences&#39; 
        /&gt;
    &quot;;

    var field = list.Fields.AddFieldAsXml(fieldSchemaXml, false, AddFieldOptions.AddFieldInternalNameHint);
    context.ExecuteQueryRetry();
}
</code></pre>
<p>To turn off Audience Targeting all you need to do is remove the field from the list.</p>

<p>And then wait a little longerâ¦</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> so if youâre joining me on this journeyâ¦</p>
<pre><code>code .</code></pre><p>Hopefully youâll see these files in your repo</p>
<p>{% asset_img âprj-files.jpgâ âProject Filesâ %}  </p>
<p>First of all lets setup the CommandSet in the manifest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <strong>src\extensions\securableCommandSet</strong> folder</li>
<li>Open the <strong>SecurableCommandSetCommandSet.manifest.json</strong> file</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="updating-the-project-files">Updating the project files</h2>
<p>Remove the two commands that were created with the project</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&quot;items&quot;: {
  &quot;COMMAND_1&quot;: {

    compareSecureCommand.visible = this.isInOwnersGroup;
  }

}</code></pre>
<p>Install the PnP client side libraries as weâre going to need some of their magic in this solution</p>
<pre><code>npm i @pnp/sp @pnp/common @pnp/logging @pnp/odata --save</code></pre><p>SharePoint Groups and their members arenât available in the <code>BaseListViewCommandSet.context</code> property, so weâre going to need to load them.</p>
<p>The problem is that this will have to be done using Promises and <code>onListViewUpdated</code> doesnât return a promise.</p>
<p>Luckily we have the <code>onInit</code> method for this (returns <code>Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>). This method gets called when you component is initialised (Basically when the list view is loaded up in the page). Anything in the <code>onInit</code> method will run before the commands are rendered, similar to the actions youâd run in the <code>componentWillMount</code> method of a react component.</p>
<p>To use the pnpjs library it needs to be initialised first and this needs to be done in the <code>onInit</code> method.</p>
<p>Add the import statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import { sp } from &quot;@pnp/sp&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>Replace the <code>onInit</code> method with the following code, this sets up the <code>sp</code> helper with context of the Extension and then to call into the SharePoint Groups in the site, weâre going to have to await away in the <code>onInit</code> method again to call into the site and set the <code>isInOwnersGroup</code> field.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">@override
public async onInit(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {

  await super.onInit();

  await sp.setup({ spfxContext: this.context });

  const email: string = this.context.pageContext.user.email;
  const ownerGroup: SiteGroup = sp.web.associatedOwnerGroup;
  const users: SPUser[] = await ownerGroup.users.get();

  this.isInOwnersGroup = users.some((user: any) =&gt; user.Email === email);

  return Promise.resolve&lt;void&gt;();
}</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>For the observant people out there, you may notice that Iâve declared <code>user</code> as <code>any</code>. For some reason, the users collection returned has UpperCamelCase properties and the TypeScript reference is using lowerCamelCase, which was causing a TypeScript compile error. Hence the <code>user.Email === email</code> rather than <code>user.email === email</code> in the <code>some</code> function call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this snippet of code, weâre getting the login of the current user, the associated owner group of the site and then getting the users in the group.</p>
<p>The <code>some</code> function determines if the user is in the group and itâs result sets the <code>isInOwnersGroup</code>.</p>
<p>Finally an update is needed on the <code>onListViewUpdated</code> method to show / hide the command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const compareSecureCommand: Command = this.tryGetCommand(&#39;CMD_SECURE&#39;);

if (compareSecureCommand) {

  compareSecureCommand.visible = this.isInOwnersGroup;
}</code></pre>
<p>Add the new command to the <code>onExecute</code> method to make sure it gets picked up in the <code>switch</code> statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">switch (event.itemId) {
  case &#39;CMD_SECURE&#39;:
    Dialog.alert(&quot;Shhhhhh! It&#39;s a secret...&quot;);
    break;
  default:
    throw new Error(&#39;Unknown command&#39;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now weâre ready to <code>gulp serve</code></p>
<p>Open up <strong>serve.json</strong> in the <strong>config</strong> directory</p>
<p>Change the two pageUrl properties to a list in your tenant</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&quot;pageUrl&quot;: &quot;https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mySite/SitePages/myPage.aspx&quot;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently there is a bug in tenants that are on First Release that stops <code>gulp serve</code> working correctly. If you canât see your command then switch to Standard (not always instant!), if it still doesnât work then try deploying without the <code>--ship</code> paramter. See all the details on the <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/3914#issuecomment-508123159">sp-dev-docs GitHub repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you account is in the Owners group (It wonât be if you created a âgroupifiedâ team site).</p>
<p>If all is good your new CommandSet should appear on the top menu and will show the alert message when clicked.</p>
<p>![âCommand Set menuâ](</p>
<p>{% asset_img âcmdset.jpgâ âCommand Set menuâ %}</p>
<p>{% asset_img âdialog.jpgâ âDialogâ %}</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Getting the SharePoint group users is just an example of how you can use the <code>onInit</code> method to call into other services, like custom web apis, MS Graph, etc.</p>
<p>Remember that this could effect the load time of your command, which may effect the user experience. The context menu may not be on screen for long, so your menu may have not loaded before itâs gone.</p>

<p>Looking at the ULS logs I noticed the following error.</p>
<p><em>Insufficient SQL database permissions for user 'Name: &lt;DOMAIN\USERNAME&gt; SID:Â &lt;SID-CODE&gt; ImpersonationLevel: None' in database '&lt;DATABASE-NAME&gt;' on SQL Server instance '&lt;SQL-INSTANCE&gt;'.

<p>The database name was referring to the Content Admin database of Central Administration and the user name was referring to the service application account that the PowerPivot service application had been configured to run under.</p>
<p>The proc_ReturnWebFeatures stored procedure required the user to be a member of the SPDataAccess role to allow EXECUTE permissions. The service application user wasÂ onlyÂ in theÂ WSS_Content_Application_Pools role.</p>
<p>If you run the following script, this will grant the correct rights in the database</p>
<p>$url = "<a href="http://centraladminsite:2013">http://centraladminsite:2013</a>"<br />
$webApp = Get-SPWebApplication -Identity $url<br />
$webApp.GrantAccessToProcessIdentity("DOMAIN\serviceapplicationuser")</p>
<p>Now when you load up the PowerPivot Management Dashboard, you report should be displayed.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>This turned out to be harder than I thought.</p>
<p>Metadata navigation and per-location views are an Â little known, but powerful way of making lists more useful.</p>
<p>It allows you to assign a default view and others views to a folder, content type or field. My need was to allow users to navigate using a Taxonomy field. Dependent on the selected field, I would like to show different fields using a view.</p>
<p>The first part is to add the Metadata navigation.</p>
<p>This is done by creating a hierarchy usingÂ MetadataNavigationHierarchy</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">
  var list = SPContext.Current.Web.Lists.TryGetList("MyList");
  var field = list.Fields.TryGetFieldByStaticName("MyField");
  var settings = MetadataNavigationSettings.GetMetadataNavigationSettings(list);
  var hierarchy = settings.FindConfiguredHierarchy(field.Id);

  if (hierarchy == null)
  {
  	hierarchy = new MetadataNavigationHierarchy(field);
  	settings.AddConfiguredHierarchy(hierarchy);
  }
  MetadataNavigationSettings.SetMetadataNavigationSettings(list, settings);
</code></pre>
<p>The hard part is adding the settings for the per location views.</p>
<p>This can only be done by injecting XML into the settings XML. MetadataNavigationSettings is a wrapper class around an XML snippet that is stored in a hidden property of the root folder of the list.</p>
<p>Have a look at SPList.RootFolder.Properties["client_MOSS_MetadataNavigationSettings"]</p>
<p>The XML Schema is as follows. Haven't found anything documenting this schema on MSDN yet, so this is just taken from my configuration of my list, so may differ on yours</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;MetadataNavigationSettings SchemaVersion="1" IsEnabled="True"
AutoIndex="True"&gt;
&lt;NavigationHierarchies&gt;
&lt;FolderHierarchy HideFoldersNode="True" /&gt;
&lt;MetadataField FieldID="a96cea49-ef78-4bfa-8a69-2c49071155fb"
FieldType="TaxonomyFieldType"
CachedName="Legal_x0020_Document_x0020_Category"
CachedDisplayName="Legal Document Category"&gt;
&lt;ViewSettings UniqueNodeId="eadcb112-33af-4700-ad11-8e6afbd800e6"&gt;
&lt;View ViewId="4f4d05f4-046f-4bfa-a37c-170847fd4e34"
CachedName="My Custom View" Index="0"
CachedUrl="Store/Forms/My Custom View.aspx" /&gt;
&lt;View ViewId="a1ab958f-40d5-4e4a-ac3f-a10bc3cd22d2"
CachedName="My Other Custom View" Index="1"
CachedUrl="Store/Forms/AllItems.aspx" /&gt;
&lt;View ViewId="5c9447a3-ff59-419a-92b1-c7f0191d6f82"
CachedName="Not visisible view" Index="-1"
CachedUrl="Store/Forms/Not visisible view.aspx" /&gt;
&lt;/ViewSettings&gt;
&lt;/MetadataField&gt;
&lt;/NavigationHierarchies&gt;
&lt;KeyFilters /&gt;
&lt;ManagedIndices&gt;
&lt;ManagedIndex IndexID="a96cea49-ef78-4bfa-8a69-2c49071155fb"
IndexFieldName="Legal_x0020_Document_x0020_Category"
IndexFieldID="a96cea49-ef78-4bfa-8a69-2c49071155fb" /&gt;
&lt;/ManagedIndices&gt;
&lt;ViewSettings UniqueNodeId=""&gt;
&lt;View ViewId="a1ab958f-40d5-4e4a-ac3f-a10bc3cd22d2"
CachedName="All Documents" Index="0"
CachedUrl="Store/Forms/AllItems.aspx" /&gt;
&lt;/ViewSettings&gt;
&lt;/MetadataNavigationSettings&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The part I'm interested in here is the ViewSettings and View tag. The UniqueId attribute relates to the GUID of the selected Term GUID. So this will show the views defined using the View tag when the Term is selected in the Metadata navigation.</p>
<p>If a View tag is added with 0 index this will be used as the default view when the term is selected, all other positive numbers will be shown in the order defined as other available views for that Term. Any negatives will not be available (You don't need to add them)</p>
<p>I used the following code to add these nodes programmaticallty using XLinq</p>
<p><code class="language-csharp"><br>
var list = SPContext.Current.Web.Lists.TryGetList("MyList");<br>
var view = list.Views.Cast().SingleOrDefault(v =&gt; v.Title == "MyView");<br>
var session = new TaxonomySession(SPContext.Current.Site);<br>
var field = list.Fields.TryGetFieldByStaticName("MyField");<br>
var term = session.GetTerm("a96cea49-ef78-4bfa-8a69-2c49071155fb");<br>
var settings = MetadataNavigationSettings.GetMetadataNavigationSettings(list);<br>
var doc = XDocument.Parse(settings.SettingsXml);<br>
var metaDataField = (from f in doc.Descendants("MetadataField")<br>
let fieldId = f.Attribute("FieldID")<br>
where fieldId != null &amp;&amp; fieldId.Value == field.Id.ToString()<br>
select f).SingleOrDefault();<br>
if (metaDataField != null)<br>
{<br>Â  var viewSettings = (from v in metaDataField.Elements("ViewSettings")<br>Â  let uniqueNodeId = v.Attribute("UniqueNodeId")<br>Â  Â  where uniqueNodeId != null &amp;&amp; uniqueNodeId.Value == term.Id.ToString()<br>Â  Â  select v).SingleOrDefault();<br>Â  if (viewSettings == null)<br>Â  {<br>
metaDataField.Add(<br>
new XElement("ViewSettings",<br>
new XAttribute("UniqueNodeId", term.Id.ToString()),<br>
new XElement("View",<br>
new XAttribute("ViewId", view.ID.ToString()),<br>
new XAttribute("CachedName", view.Title),<br>
new XAttribute("Index", "0"),<br>
new XAttribute("CachedUrl", view.Url)<br>
)<br>
)<br>
);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
settings = new MetadataNavigationSettings(doc.ToString());<br>
MetadataNavigationSettings.SetMetadataNavigationSettings(list, settings);<br>

                <p>If you have a field called "Folder" it will not be available in the returned ListItem object</p>
<p>e.g. listItem["Folder"].ToString()</p>
<p>The inner workings of the ListItem object uses an ExpandoObject to store the properties. It seems it mixes this up in the FieldValues Collection with all your custom fields. The Folder property then takes the value from the FieldValues collection to make it available to the Folder property. Thus making your own Folder field "disappear"</p>
<p>Here is how you can replicate it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a list based on the Custom List template</li>
<li>Add a column called "Folder" and make it a text field</li>
<li>Add a column called "DisplayName" and make it a text field</li>
<li>Add a column called "MyField" and make it a text field</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a couple of dummy rows of data</p>
<p>Create a console application in VS that referencesÂ Microsoft.SharePoint.Client andÂ Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime</p>
<p>Add the following code to the Main method</p>
<pre>using (var context = new ClientContext("http://siteurl"))
{
  var query = CamlQuery.CreateAllItemsQuery();
  var listItems = context.Web.Lists.GetByTitle("Testing").GetItems(query);

  context.Load(listItems);
  context.ExecuteQuery();

  foreach (var listItem in listItems)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", listItem["Title"]);
    Console.WriteLine("Folder: {0}", listItem["Folder"]);
    Console.WriteLine("DisplayName: {0}", listItem["DisplayName"]);
    Console.WriteLine("MyField: {0}", listItem["MyField"]);

<p>Here is the code from .Net Reflector that shows the ListItem object populating the properties. It's also worth noting that the other properties detailed in this method will have the same problem, but it's unlikely that you'll call a field FileSystemObject!</p>

<p>OurÂ favoriteÂ and most loved</p>
<h1>&amp; ASCII Number: 38</h1>
<p>And the impostor</p>
<h1>ï¼ ASCII Number: 65286</h1>
<p>After reading <a title="this article" href="http://nickhobbs.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/sharepoint-2010-managed-metadata-converts-ampersand-and-double-quotes-to-unicode/" target="_blank">this article</a> by <a title="Nick Hobbs" href="http://nickhobbs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Nick Hobbs</a>, it became apparent that when you create a term it replaces the 38 ampersand with a 65286 ampersand.</p>
<p>This then becomes a problem if you want to do a comparison with your original source (spreadsheet, database, etc) as they are no longer the same.</p>
<p>As detailed in Nick's article, you can use the TaxonomyItem.NormalizeName method to create a "Taxonomy" version of your string for comparison.</p>
<p>Below is the code I used in the SharePoint 2013 Client Component which is a little different from the server code.</p>
<p><span style="color:#3366ff;">string</span> myString =<span style="color:#993300;"> "This contains &amp;"</span>;<br />
<span style="color:#3366ff;">using</span> (var context = new ClientContext(<span style="color:#993300;">"http://myurl"</span>))<br />
{<br />
<span style="color:#3366ff;">var</span> result = <span style="color:#33cccc;">TaxonomyItem</span>.NormalizeName(context, myString);<br />
context.ExecuteQuery();</p>
<p><span style="color:#3366ff;">string</span> normalisedString = result.Value;<br />
}</p>
