This method gets called when you component is initialised (Basically when the list view is loaded up in the page). Anything in the <code>onInit</code> method will run before the commands are rendered, similar to the actions you’d run in the <code>componentWillMount</code> method of a react component.</p>\n<p>To use the pnpjs library it needs to be initialised first and this needs to be done in the <code>onInit</code> method.</p>\n<p>Add the import statement</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { sp } from &quot;@pnp/sp&quot;;</code></pre>\n<p>Replace the <code>onInit</code> method with the following code, this sets up the <code>sp</code> helper with context of the Extension and then to call into the SharePoint Groups in the site, we’re going to have to await away in the <code>onInit</code> method again to call into the site and set the <code>isInOwnersGroup</code> field.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">@override\npublic async onInit(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {\n\n  await super.onInit();\n\n  await sp.setup({ spfxContext: this.context });\n\n  const email: string = this.context.pageContext.user.email;\n  const ownerGroup: SiteGroup = sp.web.associatedOwnerGroup;\n  const users: SPUser[] = await ownerGroup.users.get();\n\n  this.isInOwnersGroup = users.some((user: any) =&gt; user.Email === email);\n\n  return Promise.resolve&lt;void&gt;();\n}</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the observant people out there, you may notice that I’ve declared <code>user</code> as <code>any</code>. For some reason, the users collection returned has UpperCamelCase properties and the TypeScript reference is using lowerCamelCase, which was causing a TypeScript compile error. Hence the <code>user.Email === email</code> rather than <code>user.email === email</code> in the <code>some</code> function call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this snippet of code, we’re getting the login of the current user, the associated owner group of the site and then getting the users in the group.</p>\n<p>The <code>some</code> function determines if the user is in the group and it’s result sets the <code>isInOwnersGroup</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally an update is needed on the <code>onListViewUpdated</code> method to show / hide the command.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">const compareSecureCommand: Command = this.tryGetCommand(&#39;CMD_SECURE&#39;);\n\nif (compareSecureCommand) {\n\n  compareSecureCommand.visible = this.isInOwnersGroup;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Add the new command to the <code>onExecute</code> method to make sure it gets picked up in the <code>switch</code> statement</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">switch (event.itemId) {\n  case &#39;CMD_SECURE&#39;:\n    Dialog.alert(&quot;Shhhhhh!

If you can’t see your command then switch to Standard (not always instant!), if it still doesn’t work then try deploying without the <code>--ship</code> paramter. See all the details on the <a href=\"https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/3914#issuecomment-508123159\">sp-dev-docs GitHub repository</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Make sure you account is in the Owners group (It won’t be if you created a “groupified” team site).</p>\n<p>If all is good your new CommandSet should appear on the top menu and will show the alert message when clicked.</p>\n<p>![“Command Set menu”](</p>\n<p>{% asset_img “cmdset.jpg” “Command Set menu” %}</p>\n<p>{% asset_img “dialog.jpg” “Dialog” %}</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Getting the SharePoint group users is just an example of how you can use the <code>onInit</code> method to call into other services, like custom web apis, MS Graph, etc.</p>\n<p>Remember that this could effect the load time of your command, which may effect the user experience.
